Hi, I'm Adam.

Check out [my little blog](https://maprys.net) if you want to read words I've
written.

I've been writing [Ruby][rubylang] and [Ruby on Rails][ruby-on-rails] for many
years. As a result that's what I'm most comfortable with. [Python][pythonlang]
is a close second.

[ruby-on-rails]: https://rubyonrails.org/
[pythonlang]: https://www.python.org/

Enabling static analysis tools is one of the first things I include for any new
project. Using style, analysis, metrics, and code-smell scanners are
monumentally helpful to building readable software that's easy to maintain.
Some of my favorites are [RuboCop][rubocop], [Bundler Audit][bundler-audit],
and more recently [RubyCritic][rubycritic].

[bundler-audit]: https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit
[rubycritic]: https://github.com/whitesmith/rubycritic

More recently I've began taking an interest in lower level languages like
[C][c-lang] and [Zig][ziglang], but no cool projects have come out of those
explorations yet.

[ziglang]: https://ziglang.org/
