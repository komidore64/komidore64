Hi, I'm Adam.

Check out [my little blog](https://maprys.net) if you want to read words I've
written.

I've been writing [Ruby][rubylang] and [Ruby on Rails][ruby-on-rails] for many
years. As a result that's what I'm most comfortable with.

More recently I've began taking an interest in lower level languages like
[C][c-lang] and [Zig][ziglang], but no cool projects have come out of those
explorations yet.

[rubylang]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
[ruby-on-rails]: https://rubyonrails.org/
[c-lang]: https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/
[ziglang]: https://ziglang.org/
